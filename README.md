# Voronoi_shader
A Voronoi shader for a school assignment  
Shader will place seeds for the Voronoi pattern at random locations on the 3D object. Voronoi pattern will draw in real time.  
There are different settings for the random function, true random and perlin noise random.  
There is experimental lighting which makes the shader render only where light is present.  
Controls for the different settings for the Processing app are at the top of the window.
